# ip-stats

<strong>This is a *React Js* with *Typescript* project was an experimental one, and was made for users to search for any IP information.</strong>

## please attention !
<strong>The API that's used for this project is free; therefore, I can only make HTTPS calls without signing a plan, so even with this app on Vercelm for now, you can only test it locally.</strong>
<strong>For future updates, I'm planing on create my own api to support this project, stay tunned!</strong>

## Running Features
- Search any IP
- See my own IP info (no need for typing)
    - Search geolocation information based on IP latitude and longitude (both of the above options have this)
## Execution

Currently, I run this app with the Nodemon tool and the command below. Go to package.json files in the scripts tag make sure to have:

```Javascript
"dev": "nodemon Server.js",
```

```Javascript
npm: npm start dev
```
